/*
Customers arrive in a bank according to a Poisson's process
with mean inter arrival time of 10 minutes. Customers spend
an average of 5 minutes on the single available counter, and
leave.
Write a program in C to find:
I. Probability that a customer will not have to wait at
the counter.
II. Expected number of customers in the bank.
III. Time can a customer expect to spend in the bank.
